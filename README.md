### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a begginer in the world of programming

I'm web scraping data for fun, while studyng data science

I'm looking for a real project, until now, just practicing with my simple projects

Despite that, I'm working as an ATCO for 15 years, so I'm pretty experienced in teamwork and I have a lot of soft skills

For the future, I expect change my carrear to be a full-time data scientist.

Until there, I'm accepting remote jobs!
